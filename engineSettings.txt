saveBreakout  //extract a breakout model from the input mesh, centered at point of max stress in model
saveBreakout node n  //extract a breakout model from the input mesh, centered at node with id n
stress_conversion 1E-06 Mpa(N/mm^2) //conversion from Pa to the output stress format. Name of the output format
length_conversion 1000  mm //conversion from m to the output length/displacement format. Name of the output format
needSoftSprings //use soft springs for stabilizing a poorly constrained model, e.g model is constrained vertically but my slide horizontally
                //only use this if the model is known to be in equilibrium. 
PMAX n //upper limit to p order in adaptivity (default 8). numbers higher than 8 are ignored
MAXITERATIONS n //number ofiterations in adaptivity. default 3. minimum 1 
uniformP //use uniform p-refinement instead of adaptive
ERRORTOL //error tolerance percentage for adaptivity, default 5
NOSACRIFICIAL //suppress automatic detection of sacrifical elements at singularities. not recommended unless
	      //you are intentionally studying the stress at a singulaity
econSolve  //economy solver for large models. Sets MAXITERATIONS to 2 and PMAX to 5
outputF06 //output stress in nastran ascii (.f06) format in addition to .frd format for Calculiix postprocessor
