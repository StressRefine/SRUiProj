# SRUiProj
 Prothect to create the executable for  SRui 
 Windows Visual Studio version that was last modified using VS2013.
 That and any newer version should work to compile this project.
 It is in C#. Doubleclick on the ".sln" file to open the project.
 If using a newer version than 2013, you may get a message about updating to the latest VS version, to which you should say yes.
 Choose a configuration at the top (debug or release).
 Now hit build to compile. A subfolder is created bin/debug or bin/release depending on the configuration. Inside that folder
 will be the executable SRui.exe
